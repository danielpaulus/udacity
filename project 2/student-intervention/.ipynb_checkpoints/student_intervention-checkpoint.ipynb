    "#### 1. KNN\n",
    "is generally applicable to categorization problems. It can be adapted to most problems using an appropriate distance function (besides other parameters which I think are not equally important). It should be interesting how well the lazy learning algorithm performs and how quickly the model can predict values. I expect learning times to be significantly better than the ones of the other two. The downside is, of course, that prediction times may be a lot slower. Considering the data, I can imagine that an appropriate distance function should perform quite good. In this domain I'd expect good students to be in clusters, considering their features.  F.ex. usually parents with high incomes have successful children as well.Successful industry applications include:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Decision trees\n",
    "can be used for categorization as well. They provide a quick way to create a model because they automatically choose the most important features first due to their learning algorithm. This makes feature selection easier to do as one could try to omit the features the tree puts in the end. Also decision trees work well on data that's not linearly separable. As an additional reason, the prediction time should be relatively low if the model isn't overly complex. Which leads to one of the disadvantages as decision trees tend to overfit easily when they grow too much and split more than necessary. To mitigate this effect, post-pruning of the tree needs to be applied. The last advantage of a decision tree is, that it induces a set of decision rules that can be used to explain the reasoning behind a decision, in this particular context I think this could be very beneficial. \n",
    "Successful applications of decision trees include the classification of galaxies and stars, filtering noise from hubble space telescope images, for power system security assessment and power stability prediction. Furthermore Decision Trees have applications in pharmacology for classification of drugs and applications in financial analysis. \n",

    "#### 3. SVMs\n",
    "are another obvious choice for classification. They are generally good in complicated domains with clear separation of data but tend to perform worse on when classes overlap. Also, the larger the training data gets and the more features are added, the slower SVMs become in learning and prediction times. SVMs are prone to overfitting when data is noisy. The most challenging task is to find a suitable Kernel function for the given data as this requires domain knowledge and careful parameter tuning. For the given data, I think using an SVC should be interesting because with the right tuning and kernel function it could outperform the other two classifiers in terms of accuracy. On the negative side I expect the training and prediction performance to be worse than that of the other two.  SVMs have been successfully applied for OCR,text categorization,image classification, and in biological sciences f.ex. to classify proteins. Another field of application I find particularly interesting is in Intrusion Detection Systems. \n",

Initially I was unsure as to why this is the case but now it seems clear to me. Since the tree only uses one feature, it obviously very much depends on how equally the \"good data\" in respect to the failures feature is split up in testing and training set. As a conclusion I'd say that using a decision tree is bad idea in this context as it captures very little of the information because it instantly overfits the data and the F1 Score becomes pretty much useless. \n",
