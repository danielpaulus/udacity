    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  KNN\n",
    "     KNN is generally applicable to categorization problems. It can be adapted to most problems using an appropriate distance function (besides other parameters which I think are not equally important). It should be interesting how well the lazy learning algorithm performs and how quickly the model can predict values. I expect learning times to be significantly better than the ones of the other two. The downside is, of course, that prediction times may be a lot slower. Considering the data, I can imagine that an appropriate distance function should perform quite good. In this domain I'd expect good students to be in clusters, considering their features.  F.ex. usually parents with high incomes have successful children as well.\n",
    "2.  Decision trees can be used for categorization as well. They provide a quick way to create a model because they automatically choose the most important features first due to their learning algorithm. This makes feature selection easier to do as one could try to omit the features the tree puts in the end. Also decision trees work well on data that's not linearly separable. As an additional reason, the prediction time should be relatively low if the model isn't overly complex.\n",
    "Which leads to one of the disadvantages as decision trees tend to overfit easily when they grow too much and split more than necessary. To mitigate this effect, post-pruning of the tree needs to be applied. The last advantage of a decision tree is, that it induces a set of decision rules that can be used to explain the reasoning behind a decision, in this particular context I think this could be very beneficial. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "SVMs are another obvious choice for classification. They are generally good in complicated domains with clear separation of data but tend to perform worse on when classes overlap. \n",
    "Also, the larger the training data gets and the more features are added, the slower SVMs become in learning and prediction times. \n",
    "SVMs are prone to overfitting when data is noisy. The most challenging task is to find a suitable Kernel function for the given data as this requires domain knowledge and careful parameter tuning. For the given data, I think using an SVC should be interesting because with the right tuning and kernel function it could outperform the other two classifiers in terms of accuracy. On the negative side I expect the training and prediction performance to be worse than that of the other two.  \n",

    "I have come to the conclusion that the DecisionTreeClassifier is the best model for the job. It may seem worse of a choice at first because it does worse on the test set than the other two models. I think the comparably bad F1 scores for set sizes 100 and 300 are due to the tree overfitting to the training data as can be seen by it getting the maximum F1 Score of 1 in the training set. Still the DecisionTree scores on the testing set are not completely off. I expect a significant improvement after parameter tuning &feature selection. \n",

In other words, we can not only tell people when someone will be classified as \"fail\" but also exactly why. That may come in handy especially in heated situations like student-parent-teacher relationships :-)."

    "This model will take into account the most significant data features first, and induce simple rules for the features that split the set of students in two distinct groups.  For example the amount of absences could play an important role in the decision process, so the tree would have a node that would split the students into two groups. One maybe all students with no absence time at all or asbscence time that is smaller than a certain value, and the other group will be all students with more abscences than that. Then the decision tree would go on for each of those two groups and find the next significant feature and split each group again. This process will be repeated until a small enough group of students was identified that can be used for final classification as pass or fail. \n",
    "This way, if a classification for a student has to be found, the tree will look at all the important features step by step and tell us if the student will fail or pass. Because this process is very visual and transparent, it will be possible to explain why a conclusion about a student was drawn to parents and teachers alike."
